# RWTH_WZL_Reseach_Project
During the rapid developing of artificial intelligence technology and the increasing complexity of
raw datasets, data preprocessing and preparation have become increasingly important. To train
high-quality models, there are often various targeted approaches to address the issues exposed in raw
datasets. This research project will conduct an extensive study on four common data preprocessing
topics: Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Data Augmentation, and Data Standardization. Based on
artificial intelligence and machine learning methods, we applied various algorithms including regression
models for missing data, RANSAC to detect outliers, feature mapping based on LDA and feature
clustering by PCA and K-means, GAN, RL and GPT based data augmentation for images, audios
and text data separately, and multimodal data based on pretrained model ViT and Bert. The key
aspect of the research lies in providing data preprocessing methods based on artificial intelligence or
machine learning and evaluating the specific methods by experiment results and related scientific
references. The final results illustrate that artificial intelligence and machine learning methods can
positively influence the process of data preprocessing.
